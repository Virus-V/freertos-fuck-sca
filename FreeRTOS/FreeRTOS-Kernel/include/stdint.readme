/*******************************************************************************
 * THIS IS NOT A FULL stdint.h IMPLEMENTATION - It only contains the definitions
 * necessary to build the FreeRTOS code.  It is provided to allow FreeRTOS to be
 * built using compilers that do not provide their own stdint.h definition.
 *
 * To use this file:
 *
 *    1) Copy this file into the directory that contains your FreeRTOSConfig.h
 *       header file, as that directory will already be in the compiler's include
 *       path.
 *
 *    2) Rename the copied file stdint.h.
